## What are Pipelines?

Pipelines in Dria are a way to orchestrate multiple workflows together to create complex data generation processes. They allow you to:

1. **Connect multiple workflows** in a sequence
2. **Process data in parallel** using Dria's distributed network
3. **Transform data** between workflow steps
4. **Scale** your data generation efficiently

## Pipeline Architecture

A Dria pipeline consists of:

1. **Steps**: Each step is a `StepTemplate` that defines a workflow
2. **Connections**: How steps are connected and how data flows between them
3. **Callbacks**: Functions that transform data between steps
4. **Inputs/Outputs**: The data that flows into and out of the pipeline

## Creating a Pipeline

### Step 1: Define Pipeline Steps

Each step in a pipeline is a class that inherits from `StepTemplate` and implements the `create_workflow` method:

```python
from dria_workflows import *
from dria.pipelines import StepTemplate

class TopicGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, seed_topic: str) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(seed_topic=seed_topic)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_topics",
            prompt="Generate 5 subtopics related to {{seed_topic}}. Output as a Python list.",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("topics")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_topics", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("topics")
        return builder.build()
```

### Step 2: Build the Pipeline

Use the `PipelineBuilder` to connect the steps:

```python
from dria.client import Dria
from dria.pipelines import PipelineBuilder

# Initialize Dria client
dria = Dria()

# Create pipeline builder
pipeline_builder = PipelineBuilder(dria)

# Set input
pipeline_builder.input(seed_topic="Artificial Intelligence")

# Add steps to pipeline
pipeline_builder << TopicGeneratorStep()

# Build pipeline
pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()
```

### Step 3: Run the Pipeline

Execute the pipeline to generate data:

```python
# Run the pipeline
result = pipeline.run()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Pipeline Patterns

### Sequential Pipeline

Steps are executed one after another:

```python
pipeline_builder << FirstStep() << SecondStep() << ThirdStep()
```

### Parallel Processing with Scatter

The scatter pattern allows you to process multiple items in parallel:

```python
pipeline_builder << TopicGeneratorStep().scatter() << ContentGeneratorStep()
```

This will:
1. Generate multiple topics in `TopicGeneratorStep`
2. Process each topic in parallel in `ContentGeneratorStep`

### Aggregation with Aggregate

The aggregate pattern combines multiple outputs into a single input:

```python
pipeline_builder << TopicGeneratorStep().scatter() << ContentGeneratorStep().aggregate() << SummaryStep()
```

This will:
1. Generate multiple topics
2. Process each topic in parallel to generate content
3. Combine all content and pass it to the summary step

## Callbacks

Callbacks transform data between steps. Dria provides three built-in callbacks:

1. **Scatter**: 1-to-N mapping, processes each item in a list in parallel
2. **Broadcast**: 1-to-N mapping, duplicates input to multiple tasks
3. **Aggregate**: N-to-1 mapping, combines multiple outputs into a single input

### Custom Callbacks

You can define custom callbacks by implementing the `callback` method in your `StepTemplate`:

```python
def callback(self, step: "Step") -> Union[List[TaskInput], TaskInput]:
    # Process the output of the step
    outputs = [parse_json(o.result) for o in step.output]
    
    # Transform the data
    transformed = [transform_data(item) for item in outputs]
    
    # Return a TaskInput object or a list of TaskInput objects
    return TaskInput(**{"transformed_data": transformed})
```

## Complex Pipeline Example

Here's a complete example of a pipeline that:
1. Generates topics from a seed topic
2. Generates content for each topic in parallel
3. Combines the content into a coherent article

```python
from dria_workflows import *
from dria.pipelines import StepTemplate, Pipeline, PipelineBuilder
from dria.client import Dria

# Define pipeline steps
class TopicGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, seed_topic: str) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(seed_topic=seed_topic)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_topics",
            prompt="Generate 5 subtopics related to {{seed_topic}}. Output as a Python list.",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("topics")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_topics", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("topics")
        return builder.build()

class ContentGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, topic: str) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(topic=topic)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_content",
            prompt="Write a paragraph about {{topic}}",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("content")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_content", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("content")
        return builder.build()

class ArticleGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, contents: list) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(contents=contents)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_article",
            prompt="Combine these paragraphs into a coherent article: {{contents}}",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("article")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_article", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("article")
        return builder.build()

# Initialize Dria client
dria = Dria()

# Create pipeline builder
pipeline_builder = PipelineBuilder(dria)

# Set input
pipeline_builder.input(seed_topic="Climate Change")

# Add steps to pipeline
pipeline_builder << TopicGeneratorStep().scatter() << ContentGeneratorStep().aggregate() << ArticleGeneratorStep()

# Build pipeline
pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()

# Run pipeline
result = pipeline.run()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Design Before Implementation**: Plan your pipeline structure before coding
2. **Keep Steps Focused**: Each step should do one thing well
3. **Handle Errors**: Add error handling to make your pipelines robust
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use callbacks to monitor pipeline execution
5. **Optimize for Parallelism**: Design your pipelines to take advantage of parallel processing
