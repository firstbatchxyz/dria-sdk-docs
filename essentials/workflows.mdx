## What are Workflows?

In Dria, a workflow is a sequence of steps that define how data is generated, processed, and transformed. Workflows are the building blocks of pipelines and allow you to create complex data generation processes.

## Workflow Components

A workflow in Dria consists of several key components:

### 1. Steps

Steps are individual operations in a workflow. Each step performs a specific task, such as generating text, searching the web, or transforming data.

Common types of steps include:

- **Generative Steps**: Generate text using language models
- **Search Steps**: Retrieve information from the web
- **Function Steps**: Execute custom functions for data processing
- **Decision Steps**: Control flow based on conditions

### 2. Flow

The flow defines the connections between steps, determining the order of execution and how data flows from one step to another.

### 3. Inputs and Outputs

Each step can have inputs (data it receives) and outputs (data it produces). Outputs from one step can be used as inputs to subsequent steps.

## Building a Workflow

Workflows are built using the `WorkflowBuilder` class. Here's a simple example:

```python
from dria_workflows import *

# Create a workflow builder
builder = WorkflowBuilder(instruction="Generate a story about space exploration")

# Add a generative step
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_story",
    prompt="Write a short story about {{instruction}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("story")],
)

# Define the flow
flow = [Edge(source="generate_story", target="_end")]
builder.flow(flow)

# Set the return value
builder.set_return_value("story")

# Build the workflow
workflow = builder.build()
```

## Step Types

### Generative Steps

Generative steps use language models to generate text based on prompts:

```python
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_content",
    prompt="Write a paragraph about {{topic}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("content")],
)
```

### Search Steps

Search steps retrieve information from the web:

```python
builder.search_step(
    id="web_search",
    query="latest developments in {{topic}}",
    operator=Operator.WEB_SEARCH,
    outputs=[Write.new("search_results")],
)
```

### Function Steps

Function steps execute custom functions:

```python
def process_data(data):
    # Process the data
    return processed_data

builder.function_step(
    id="process_data",
    function=process_data,
    inputs={"data": "{{raw_data}}"},
    outputs=[Write.new("processed_data")],
)
```

## Flow Control

The flow of a workflow is defined using `Edge` objects, which connect steps together:

```python
flow = [
    Edge(source="step1", target="step2"),
    Edge(source="step2", target="step3"),
    Edge(source="step3", target="_end")
]
builder.flow(flow)
```

You can also create conditional flows:

```python
flow = [
    Edge(source="step1", target="step2"),
    Edge(source="step2", target="step3", condition="{{condition}} == true"),
    Edge(source="step2", target="step4", condition="{{condition}} == false"),
    Edge(source="step3", target="_end"),
    Edge(source="step4", target="_end")
]
builder.flow(flow)
```

## Template Variables

Dria uses a template system with double curly braces `{{variable}}` to reference variables within prompts and conditions:

```python
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_content",
    prompt="Write a paragraph about {{topic}} with a focus on {{aspect}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("content")],
)
```

## Executing Workflows

Once a workflow is built, it can be executed using the Dria client:

```python
from dria.client import Dria

# Initialize the Dria client
dria = Dria()

# Execute the workflow
result = dria.execute(workflow, inputs={"topic": "Artificial Intelligence", "aspect": "ethics"})

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive IDs**: Give your steps clear, descriptive IDs to make your workflow easier to understand and debug.

2. **Keep Prompts Clear**: Write clear, specific prompts for generative steps to get the best results.

3. **Handle Errors**: Consider what might go wrong in your workflow and add error handling where appropriate.

4. **Test Incrementally**: Build and test your workflow incrementally, adding one step at a time.

5. **Reuse Workflows**: Create reusable workflows for common tasks to improve efficiency.
