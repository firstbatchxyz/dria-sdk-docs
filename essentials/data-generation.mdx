## Data Generation Strategies

### 1. Prompt Engineering

The quality of your synthetic data depends heavily on the prompts you use. Here are some techniques for effective prompt engineering:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Clear Instructions">
    Provide clear, specific instructions in your prompts:
    
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_customer_review",
        prompt="""
        Generate a realistic customer review for a smartphone with the following characteristics:
        - Product: {{product_name}}
        - Rating: {{rating}} out of 5 stars
        - Length: 100-150 words
        - Tone: {{tone}}
        - Include at least one specific feature the customer liked
        - Include at least one specific feature the customer disliked
        
        Output only the review text, nothing else.
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("review")],
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Few-Shot Examples">
    Include examples in your prompts to guide the model:
    
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_medical_dialogue",
        prompt="""
        Generate a realistic dialogue between a doctor and a patient discussing {{condition}}.
        
        Example 1:
        Doctor: Good morning. What brings you in today?
        Patient: I've been having these headaches for the past week.
        Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the pain?
        Patient: It's a throbbing pain on the right side of my head.
        
        Example 2:
        Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
        Patient: I've been feeling very tired lately, even after sleeping well.
        Doctor: How long has this been going on?
        Patient: About three weeks now.
        
        Now generate a new, unique dialogue about {{condition}}:
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("dialogue")],
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="sliders" title="Controlling Output Format">
    Specify the exact format you want:
    
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_structured_data",
        prompt="""
        Generate 5 examples of customer data in JSON format with the following fields:
        - name: Full name
        - age: Between 18 and 80
        - email: Valid email address
        - purchase_history: Array of 1-3 product names
        
        Format the output as a valid JSON array.
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("customer_data")],
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Iterative Refinement

Generate data in multiple steps, refining it at each stage:

```python
builder = WorkflowBuilder(instruction="Generate a complex dataset")

# Step 1: Generate initial data
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_initial",
    prompt="Generate an initial draft of {{instruction}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("initial_data")],
)

# Step 2: Refine the data
builder.generative_step(
    id="refine_data",
    prompt="Improve this data by adding more detail and ensuring consistency: {{initial_data}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("refined_data")],
)

# Step 3: Validate the data
builder.generative_step(
    id="validate_data",
    prompt="Check this data for errors, inconsistencies, or unrealistic values: {{refined_data}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("validation_report")],
)

# Step 4: Final version
builder.generative_step(
    id="final_data",
    prompt="Create the final version of the data, addressing these issues: {{validation_report}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("final_data")],
)

flow = [
    Edge(source="generate_initial", target="refine_data"),
    Edge(source="refine_data", target="validate_data"),
    Edge(source="validate_data", target="final_data"),
    Edge(source="final_data", target="_end")
]

builder.flow(flow)
```

### 3. Data Enrichment

Enrich your synthetic data with real-world information:

```python
builder = WorkflowBuilder(topic="Electric Vehicles")

# Search for real-world information
builder.search_step(
    id="web_search",
    query="latest developments in {{topic}}",
    operator=Operator.WEB_SEARCH,
    outputs=[Write.new("search_results")],
)

# Generate data grounded in real information
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_grounded_data",
    prompt="""
    Using this information: {{search_results}}
    
    Generate 5 realistic news headlines about {{topic}} that could appear in major publications.
    Each headline should be factually accurate and reflect current trends.
    """,
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("headlines")],
)

flow = [
    Edge(source="web_search", target="generate_grounded_data"),
    Edge(source="generate_grounded_data", target="_end")
]

builder.flow(flow)
```

### 4. Diversity and Variation

Generate diverse data by explicitly requesting variation:

```python
builder = WorkflowBuilder(base_scenario="A customer service interaction")

builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_diverse_scenarios",
    prompt="""
    Generate 10 variations of {{base_scenario}} with different:
    - Customer demographics (age, gender, background)
    - Customer issues (technical problem, billing question, product inquiry)
    - Emotional states (calm, frustrated, confused)
    - Complexity levels (simple to complex)
    
    Format each scenario as a brief description.
    """,
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("diverse_scenarios")],
)
```

## Specialized Data Generation

### Text Data

Generate various types of text data:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Conversations">
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_conversation",
        prompt="""
        Generate a realistic conversation between two people discussing {{topic}}.
        The conversation should have 10-15 turns and include natural elements like:
        - Questions and answers
        - Agreements and disagreements
        - Interruptions
        - Filler words and hesitations
        
        Format as:
        Person A: [text]
        Person B: [text]
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("conversation")],
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Articles">
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_article",
        prompt="""
        Write a news article about {{event}} with:
        - A compelling headline
        - 4-5 paragraphs of content
        - Quotes from at least 2 different sources
        - Background information on the topic
        - A conclusion that summarizes the key points
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("article")],
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Q&A Pairs">
    ```python
    builder.generative_step(
        id="generate_qa_pairs",
        prompt="""
        Generate 10 question-answer pairs about {{topic}}.
        Include a mix of:
        - Factual questions
        - Opinion-based questions
        - Simple and complex questions
        
        Format as:
        Q1: [question]
        A1: [answer]
        """,
        operator=Operator.GENERATION,
        outputs=[Write.new("qa_pairs")],
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Structured Data

Generate structured data in specific formats:

```python
from dria.functions import structured_output

# Define the schema
schema = {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "id": {"type": "string"},
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "age": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 18, "maximum": 80},
            "occupation": {"type": "string"},
            "income": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0},
            "education": {"type": "string"},
            "interests": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
        },
        "required": ["id", "name", "age", "occupation"]
    }
}

# Generate structured data
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_structured_data",
    prompt="Generate 10 examples of diverse user profiles",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    function=structured_output(schema),
    outputs=[Write.new("user_profiles")],
)
```

## Quality Control

### Model-as-a-Judge

Use a model to evaluate and filter generated data:

```python
builder = WorkflowBuilder(instruction="Generate medical case studies")

# Generate initial data
builder.generative_step(
    id="generate_case_studies",
    prompt="Generate 5 detailed medical case studies about {{instruction}}",
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("case_studies")],
)

# Evaluate the quality
builder.generative_step(
    id="evaluate_quality",
    prompt="""
    Evaluate these medical case studies for:
    1. Medical accuracy
    2. Realism
    3. Educational value
    4. Ethical considerations
    
    For each case study, provide a score from 1-10 and brief explanation.
    
    Case studies:
    {{case_studies}}
    """,
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("evaluation")],
)

# Filter based on quality
builder.generative_step(
    id="filter_case_studies",
    prompt="""
    Based on this evaluation:
    {{evaluation}}
    
    Select only the case studies that scored 8 or higher.
    
    Original case studies:
    {{case_studies}}
    """,
    operator=Operator.GENERATION,
    outputs=[Write.new("filtered_case_studies")],
)

flow = [
    Edge(source="generate_case_studies", target="evaluate_quality"),
    Edge(source="evaluate_quality", target="filter_case_studies"),
    Edge(source="filter_case_studies", target="_end")
]

builder.flow(flow)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Factory Tools

Dria provides pre-built factory tools for specialized data generation:

```python
from dria.factory import SimpleGenerator, ClairGenerator, CodeGenerator

# Use the Simple Generator for basic text generation
simple_gen = SimpleGenerator(dria_client)
result = simple_gen.generate(prompt="Write a short story about time travel")

# Use CLAIR for more complex, reasoning-based generation
clair_gen = ClairGenerator(dria_client)
result = clair_gen.generate(
    instruction="Explain quantum computing to a high school student",
    criteria="Clear, accurate, engaging, appropriate for the audience"
)

# Generate code examples
code_gen = CodeGenerator(dria_client)
result = code_gen.generate(
    instruction="Write a Python function to find the longest palindrome in a string",
    language="python"
)
```

### Scaling Data Generation

Use pipelines to scale your data generation:

```python
# Define pipeline steps for massive data generation
class TopicGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, domain: str) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(domain=domain)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_topics",
            prompt="Generate 20 specific topics related to {{domain}}. Output as a Python list.",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("topics")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_topics", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("topics")
        return builder.build()

class ContentGeneratorStep(StepTemplate):
    def create_workflow(self, topic: str) -> Workflow:
        builder = WorkflowBuilder(topic=topic)
        builder.generative_step(
            id="generate_content",
            prompt="Write a detailed article about {{topic}}",
            operator=Operator.GENERATION,
            outputs=[Write.new("content")],
        )
        flow = [Edge(source="generate_content", target="_end")]
        builder.flow(flow)
        builder.set_return_value("content")
        return builder.build()

# Build a pipeline that can generate hundreds of articles
dria = Dria()
pipeline_builder = PipelineBuilder(dria)
pipeline_builder.input(domain="Artificial Intelligence")
pipeline_builder << TopicGeneratorStep().scatter() << ContentGeneratorStep()
pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()
result = pipeline.run()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small-scale generation and gradually scale up
2. **Validate Quality**: Implement quality checks at each stage of generation
