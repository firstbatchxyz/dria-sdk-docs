At its core, Dria consists of:

- A powerful framework for creating, managing, and orchestrating synthetic data pipelines
- A sophisticated multi-agent network that can synthesize data from web and siloed sources
- An extensive factory of built-in tools derived from verified research papers to accelerate data generation


## Understanding Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental building blocks of Dria's data generation system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Workflow">
    A workflow is a structured sequence of steps that defines how synthetic data is generated, processed, and validated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compose Modular Components">
    Complex data generation tasks are broken down into modular components that can be combined and reused across different projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize for Your Needs">
    Each workflow can be tailored to specific data requirements, allowing precise control over the generation process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestrate Execution">
    Dria manages the execution of workflows, handling dependencies, parallelization, and resource allocation automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

To begin using Dria, you'll need to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Dria works with Python 3.10 or higher and can be installed via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install dria
    ```
    
    Or using conda:
    ```bash
    conda create -n dria python=3.10
    conda activate dria
    pip install dria
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Workflow">
    Define the steps needed to generate your synthetic data using our intuitive workflow API.
    ```python
    from dria import Dria, WorkflowTemplate, Model

    class SimpleWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
        def define_workflow(self) -> None:
            self.add_step("Write a short story about a {{topic}}")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Synthetic Data">
    Execute your workflow and collect the generated data through our simple interface.
    ```python
    dria = Dria()
    result = asyncio.run(dria.generate(
        inputs={"topic": "an apple"},
        workflow=SimpleWorkflow,
        models=Model.GEMINI
    ))
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
