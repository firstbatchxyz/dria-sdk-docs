```bash
conda create -n dria python=3.10
conda activate dria
```

Then install the SDK:

```bash
pip install dria
```

If you encounter any installation issues:

## Creating a Multi-Step Workflow

Before diving into pipelines, let's explore how to create a single workflow with multiple steps.

### Import Required Libraries

```python
from dria import Dria, WorkflowTemplate, Model
```

### Define a Multi-Step Workflow

```python

class MultiStepWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    """
    A workflow demonstrating multiple processing steps within a single workflow.

    This workflow shows how to define multiple sequential steps that build upon
    each other, with each step taking the output of the previous step as input.
    """

    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        # Step 1: Generate initial ideas based on the prompt
        idea_creation_step = self.add_step(
            "Generate 3 creative ideas related to: {{prompt}}",
            output="idea_creation"
        )

        # Step 2: Select the best idea from the generated list
        idea_selection_step = self.add_step(
            "Review these ideas:\n{{idea_creation}}\n\nSelect the most promising idea and explain why it stands out.",
            output="idea_selection"
        )

        # Step 3: Expand the selected idea with more details
        idea_expansion_step = self.add_step(
            "Expand this idea with additional details, examples, and potential applications:\n{{idea_selection}}",
            output="idea_expansion"
        )

        # Step 4: Create an outline for a full article
        outline_creation_step = self.add_step(
            "Create a detailed outline for an article based on this expanded idea:\n{{idea_expansion}}",
            output="outline_creation"
        )

        # Connect the steps in a sequence
        self.connect(idea_creation_step, idea_selection_step)
        self.connect(idea_selection_step, idea_expansion_step)
        self.connect(idea_expansion_step, outline_creation_step)

```

### Run the Multi-Step Workflow

```python
async def run_multi_step_example():
    dria = Dria()

    # Execute a single workflow with sequential steps
    result = await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "prompt": "Sustainable urban farming technologies"
        },
        workflow=MultiStepWorkflow,  # Single workflow with multiple sequential steps
        models=Model.GEMINI,
    )

    # The result will be a single output (the article outline)
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    print(asyncio.run(run_multi_step_example()))
```

In this example:
- We define a single workflow with 4 sequential steps that execute in order
- Each step builds on the output of the previous step using the output key of the previous step
- The callback simply returns the final result (the article outline), as we're interested in the end product of this sequential process

## Your First Dria Workflow Pipeline

Let's create a simple pipeline that generates variations of a given instruction and then executes them.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
from dria import Dria, WorkflowTemplate, Model, DriaDataset, TaskResult
from typing import List, Any
```

### Step 2: Define Steps

First, let's create a step that generates variations of an instruction:

```python
class FirstWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    """
    First workflow in the pipeline.

    This workflow takes a prompt as input and generates initial content.
    The callback transforms the raw results into a structured format
    that can be consumed by the next workflow in the pipeline.
    """
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        self.add_step("{{prompt}}")

    def callback(self, result: List[TaskResult]) -> Any:
        return [{"idea": r.result for r in result}]

```

Next, let's create a step that executes each variation:

```python
class SecondWorkflow(WorkflowTemplate):
    """
    Second workflow in the pipeline.

    This workflow takes the structured output from the first workflow
    and expands it into a full article. It demonstrates how to use
    the output of a previous workflow as input to a subsequent one.
    """
    def define_workflow(self) -> None:
        self.add_step("Expand on this to article: {{idea}}")
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the Pipeline

Now, let's connect these steps into a pipeline:

```python
async def main():
    # Initializes the Dria client, configures a dataset for storing results,
    # and executes a two-stage workflow pipeline with the specified model.
    dria = Dria()

    # Initialize DriaDataset, which can stores workflow executions for data accessibility.
    dataset = DriaDataset(collection="test-pipeline")

    # Execute workflows in a pipeline
    return await dria.generate(
        inputs={
            "prompt": "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint" # Initial prompt for first workflow
        },
        workflow=[FirstWorkflow, SecondWorkflow], # Packed each workflow as list
        models=Model.GEMINI, # All GEMINI models are selected
        dataset=dataset
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```
## Understanding the Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Workflow Structure">
    Our pipeline has two sequential workflows:
    1. **FirstWorkflow**: Takes the initial prompt and generates creative ideas
    2. **SecondWorkflow**: Takes each idea from the first workflow and expands it into a full article
    
    The callback function in FirstWorkflow transforms the results into a format that can be consumed by SecondWorkflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workflow Templates">
    Each workflow is defined using the `WorkflowTemplate` class, which allows you to:
    - Define steps with the `add_step()` method
    - Process and transform results with the `callback()` method
    - Pass data between workflows in a structured format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Execution">
    Dria handles the execution of your workflows using the specified model (Gemini in this example). The framework:
    - Passes your initial inputs to the first workflow
    - Processes the results through any defined callbacks
    - Feeds the transformed data to subsequent workflows
    - Stores results in the specified dataset for future reference
  </Step>
</Steps>
